- Positive Reinforcement: For users expressing positive feelings, the assistant reinforces this positivity with affirmations and encouragement to maintain a healthy mindset.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Gradio, the chatbot features an intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the assistant in a conversational manner.

In here, I will assist step by step about how you can talk to Mental Health Assistant by ask to the bot according to your mood and the Chatbot will give you the answer according to your mood.


### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
## Getting Started

Before you can use this project, you must follow the requirements here
### Prerequisites

1. Open your Google Colab and create a new project. 

2. Before to run, make sure you connect and choose T4 GPU by clicking connect dropdown, choose change run time, choose hardware accelerator from CPU to T4 GPU to make a model faster to load. And afterthat, click save. 

3. Install Required Libraries
Run the following code to install the necessary libraries:

  ```sh
  !pip install transformers torch gradio
  ```

4. Import Libraries
Import the required libraries:

 ```sh
import torch
from transformers import pipeline
import gradio as gr
  ```

5. Load the Sentiment Analysis Model
Load a pre-trained sentiment analysis model from Hugging Face:

 ```sh
sentiment_analysis = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
  ```

6. Define the Chatbot Logic
Create a function that detects the user's sentiment and provides uplifting messages:

 ```sh
def mental_health_chatbot(user_input):
    # Analyze the sentiment of the user input

 ```sh
def chat_interface(user_input):
    return mental_health_chatbot(user_input)

# Create the Gradio interface
iface = gr.Interface(
    fn=chat_interface,
    inputs="text",
    outputs="text",
    title="Mental Health Assistant",
    description="A chatbot that detects when you are feeling down and provides uplifting and supportive messages."
